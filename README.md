Predicting the Federal Fund Effective Rates: A Machine Learning Approach
## Description

The Federal Reserve Banks adjust rates throughout the year depending on the financial landscape observed by monitoring key indicators.

The fed funds rate impacts short-term and long-term interest rates and foreign exchange rates. It also plays into broader economic considerations, like growth and employment.

This project aims to build a model to predict the Federal Funds Effective Rate.
